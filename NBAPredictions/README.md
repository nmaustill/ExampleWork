The goal of this project was to predict when players should be drafted in the 2020 NBA draft.

I looked at past draftees to see how their NCAA statistics compared to their NBA statistics during their first 4 years.

I then used that data to predict NBA stats for the 2020 draft class based on their NCAA statistics.

In the predictions spreadsheet, the data can be sorted by different types of stats to determine how good they are projected to be.

This isn't perfect but it mostly worked as expected. There are a few things I would change (and still plan on adjusting).
I noticed that there were a couple of stats that didn't appear to have predictions that made sense.
I could use different types of models to get those predictions more real and sensible as I only used one model because I was pressed for time.
My code also isn't generalized for future use, so I could work on that to get it to play nice and use it in the future.
I also predicted the pick that each player should end up as but I did so using NCAA stats where I should have used the projected NBA stats.

I am certain there are plenty of other adjustments that could be made in order to make this better but this is just what I have come across.
